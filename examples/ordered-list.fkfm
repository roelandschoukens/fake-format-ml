Ordered lists
=============

No surprises here:

1. decimal
2. decimal

a. alphanumeric
b. alphanumeric

Roman lists present some ambiguity, this is why we must break the list above.
We only recognise I, V, and X as roman bullets to get less ambiguity

i. roman first item
ii. roman
    second item
iii. roman third item

01. with leading zero
02. with leading zero

If bullets vary in length they must align left to a fixed margin:

    8. Item
    9. Item
    10. Item
    11. Item

Note in the example above that Fakeformat doesnâ€™t care about the actual numbers; the
list in the output just starts at 1.
