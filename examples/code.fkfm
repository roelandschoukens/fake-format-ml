Here is a code block. Code blocks in Fakeformat are always 'fenced'. An plain indented block
will be translated in a `blockquote`, not a code block.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

As with other blocks you can nest this inside an indented block.

{style="background: #ffa;"}
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        printf("Hello World\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```
